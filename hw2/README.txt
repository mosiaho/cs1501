Overview: In the course repository, you will find a data file "words.csv".
This file contains a list of 10,000 words with their associated frequency. 
For the first part of this assignment, we implement a HashMap with LinkedList
Chaining (as described in class) so that we can associate each word with its
corresponding frequency.For the second part of this assignment, we devise basic 
tests to evaluate the effectiveness of our hash function.
